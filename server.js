// AS A social media startup
// I WANT an API for my social network that uses a NoSQL database
// SO THAT my website can handle large amounts of unstructured data

// GIVEN a social network API
// WHEN I enter the command to invoke the application
// THEN my server is started and the Mongoose models are synced to the MongoDB database
// WHEN I open API GET routes in Insomnia for users and thoughts
// THEN the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON
// WHEN I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia
// THEN I am able to successfully create, update, and delete users and thoughts in my database
// WHEN I test API POST and DELETE routes in Insomnia
// THEN I am able to successfully create and delete reactions to thoughts and add and remove friends to a userâ€™s friend list

// Bring in required packages, set up middleware and routes

});

// Logs the queries being executed against the database
