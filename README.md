## Description
This application is an API for a social networking site, created to take advantage of a NoSQL backend database -- in this case, MongoDB serves as our database server. It is written in JavaScript and runs on Node with an Express API to interact with the MongoDB database. Packages used include Express for web framework, and Mongoose for Object Document Modeling (ODM) work with the MongoDB backend.
